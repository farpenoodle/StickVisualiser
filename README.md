#Fight Stick Visualiser
##About
A quick and dirty fight stick visualiser I put together for the launch of Street Fighter V on PC.

##How to use
Just add stickvisualiser.html to your stream. Size is controlled by the width of the browser window. Press any button on your stick then follow the prompts to bind your controls to the right inputs. Double click on the overlay to clear bindings.

##Advanced
It's possible to use more than one instance of the overlay to display multiple fight sticks. Make a copy of stickvisualiser.html and look for ```var mappingName = 'stickmapping'``` and change ```stickmapping``` to whatever you want.
